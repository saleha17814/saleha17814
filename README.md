ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Saleha (@saleha17814), a passionate UI/UX Designer and Web Developer with a strong interest in creating user-centered digital experiences. My journey in tech has been fueled by a blend of creativity and technical expertise, allowing me to craft intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. Iâ€™m particularly interested in User Experience & Interface Design, where I focus on designing seamless and accessible interfaces that prioritize user satisfaction. Additionally, Iâ€™m dedicated to Web Development, building responsive and dynamic websites, and exploring the potential of Artificial Intelligence in enhancing user interactions and solving complex problems.

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into mobile app interface design and advanced UI/UX principles, aiming to create designs that not only look good but also deliver exceptional usability. Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on design projects, whether itâ€™s a website, mobile app, or a branding project, and Iâ€™m eager to contribute to open-source projects that focus on improving user experience and accessibility. I love working on innovative tech solutions that push the boundaries of technology and design.
